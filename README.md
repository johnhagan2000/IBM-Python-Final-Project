# IBM-Python-Final-Project
This is the Final Project for IBM Course Python Project for Data Science (Course 5 of 9 for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate).
This projects involves web scraping stock date for Tesla and Gamestop, along with using the API for Yahoo Finance (yfinance) to grab past stock data.

This project shows what I have learned so far in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate involving the process of web scraping using the Python's Requests library, knowledge of APIs, and data cleaning and manipulation using Pandas.
